# HomeDepot (CS120 HIGH SCHOOL JAVA ASSIGNMENT)
Consumers can use the Home Depot website to order hardware items.  Your job is to use Java to write a program that will “process” the online order, calculate the final price, including 13% HST, for hardware items and output the complete details of the order for the consumer.  Use the following items and prices when designing your program:
      
Nuts = 5 cents each 

Bolts = 5 cents each 

Washers = 2 cents each 

# A minimum order of 50 of each item must be ordered before the order can be processed.

# Your program should do all of the following:

1.	Obtain input from the customer regarding the quantity of nuts, bolts and washers they want to buy. 

2.	Only accept orders that meet the minimum quantities. (For the purpose of this program, just give the user one single attempt to fix each invalid input.  If the second input is also invalid, assign the minimum number.)

3.	Output the Sub-Total (before sales tax is added). 

4.	Output the Total cost of the order, including sales tax.

5.	Thank the customer for shopping at Home Depot.
